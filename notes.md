# Emoji project

Don't generate emoji picture

## Idea 1: Generate sequence of existing emojis (easier) 

- Stemming
- Word embedding (neural network)
- Cosine similarity
- Parsing ???

## Idea 2: Have original message mixed with emojis that are generated (hard) 
- Neural network

# Simple solution:

1. Text pre-processing - stemming
2. Mapping from words to emoji words - search in emojis
3. Output

# Middle solution (added embeddings)

1. Text pre-processing - stemming
2. Embed stemmed sentence
3. Get embeddings for emojis
4. Calculate similarity between each word and emojis

The project goal: I have to poo -> ğŸ™‹ğŸš½ğŸ’©

# Harder solution: (maybe try doing after we have previous)

Something similar to https://github.com/gghati/Emojifier

# We don't have a life solution and nothing better to do:
